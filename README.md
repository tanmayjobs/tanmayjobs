- 👋 Hi, I’m @tanmayjobs
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and I've worked on c, cpp, python, dart, javascript, java and bash scripts.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about python and trying to understand how it works behind the scenes.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on custom python interpreter. I'm curious about python interpreter and want to create of my own, so if you're interested in the same then let's work together.
- 📫 How to reach me. Mail me on tanmayjobs619@gmail.com
- ✨ Some things which I've done for fun,
  - I've created custom ubuntu bootup screen(plymouth).
  - I've created slideshow wallpaper script for ubuntu.
  - I've created custom library for dart using kotlin to access the list of all installed applications on android.
  - I've created custom library for dart using java to use bluetooth printer but due to some reasons(money), I was unable to test it.
  - I've replicated the functionality staticmethod and classmethod class decorators using function decorator in python.
